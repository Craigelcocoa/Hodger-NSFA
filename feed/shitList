Latest stuff from hodger site
- need to now modify under11.html jquery code to build the players list dynamically in the same format its currently in. After that we need to:
make some form validation for the admin screen functions - player first name and surname must be entered
 - validation of manager details
 - if squad list is empty should we disable the button? Maybe Jquery can load json and then at time of building that section, if = 0 disable button
- sort out remove squad list first item - looks like some kind of existing tag, remove
- need to reload page once edits are made - do this in the success callback - can we manually call document.ready? -document.location.reload(true) - works, add to all .done callbacks

- Add teams (should be done this way so that typos dont break the system cos can then select teams from drop down when entering a fixture)
- remove teams

- Add fixture - date, ground?, home team, away team, hscore, ascore, result
- remove fixture
- need facililty to edit fixture to add results - maybe this could be added to remove fixture - simply get all that are marked for deletion and delete and then completely rebuild textfile for others in case they have had their score added/changed?

- Add schools (required so that when building team list, can summarise by school without being affected by typos and inconsistency)
- Remove school
